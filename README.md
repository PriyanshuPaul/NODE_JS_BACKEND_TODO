# NODE_JS_BACKEND_TODO
A simple backend application where I am aiming to create a to-do list where in user can insert a todo record with a sample schema like: - task name - task description - creator - duration - createdAt . There would be 2 endpoints and the record will be deleted after the duration has passed.
