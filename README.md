# NODE_JS_BACKEND_TODO
A simple backend application where I am aiming to create a to-do list where in user can insert a todo record with a sample schema like: - task name - task description - creator - duration - createdAt . There would be 2 endpoints and the record will be deleted after the duration has passed.

In the first day I have created the to-do list using Express,NodeJs and MongoDB.I can make api calls successfully to add and display the users as well as the tasks assigned from the database itself.
I tried inserting TTL instance so that records get deleted automatically but results are not upto the mark.
